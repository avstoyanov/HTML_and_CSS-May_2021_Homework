              All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable
              of which is a long trunk (also called a

              and grasping objects. Their

              grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for
              moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to
              control their body temperature. Their
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column" 
                >pillar</a
              >-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have
              larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller
              ears and convex or level backs.

              due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to
              keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as

              in which multiple family groups come together to socialise.
              Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist
              of one female with her calves or several related females with
              offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the

              Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty
              and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly

              their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three
              years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They

              jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at
              the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones.
              The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the
              elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing
              teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out
              at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age.
              The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and
              usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life.
              Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker
              and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.<sup

              difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed,
              ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks
              serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water,
              salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees
              and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus" >anus</a

              typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or
              reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some
              patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears
              and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair,
              especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair
              darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and
              bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin,

                >musth</a
              >. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at
              the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older
              than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while
              half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls
              appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while
              older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December).
              The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from
              the

              >, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours
              associated with musth include walking with the head held high and
              swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling
              and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to
              four months.<sup

              encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In
              contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win
              the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger.
              A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth
              male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other.
              Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases,
              and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.<sup

              Touching is an important form of communication among elephants.
              Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks;
              the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants
              use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones.
              Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths,
              temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or
              when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues.
              Touching is especially important for mother–calf communication.
              When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their
              trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf
              is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its
              mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her
              breast or leg.<sup

              Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants
              will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and
              spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their
              heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and
              vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these
              actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones
              will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears
              against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will
              position their ears in a V shape.<sup

              Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by

              At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been
              identified. A greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family
              group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls
              are soft,

              >
              sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their
              group and may be responded to with a "contact answer" call that
              starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble is
              emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that
              it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a
              distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the
              "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female
              chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several
              cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow
              after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls
              of excitement known as the "mating pandemonium".<sup

              acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on
              their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle
              ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and
              put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the
              "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited
              for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain
              cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat

              Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An

              Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory
              trade, as females usually lack tusks. Still, members of the

              The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human
              populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other

              terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human
              encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small
              islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants
              cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size
              and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume
              crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both
              elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result.
              Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation.<sup

              Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of
              war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and
              their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were
              large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier
              and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to
              the ground and impale him.<sup

              Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of
              surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time,
              strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into
              an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and
              Parthians.<sup

              were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. They were often
              depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like
              trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves.
